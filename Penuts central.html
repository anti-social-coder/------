                </h2>

                <p>
                Instances of SCP-PAE are to be contained in a hermetically sealed chamber made of reinforced tungsten alloy, measuring no less than 10m x 10m x 10m.
                The chamber must remain pressurized with inert gas at all times to prevent activation of SCP-PAE's anomalous properties.
                Personnel entering the chamber must wear reinforced, peanut-proof containment suits and must not consume peanuts within 72 hours prior to entry.
                Under no circumstances are personnel to attempt to communicate with SCP-PAE entities. In the event of a containment breach, Mobile Task Force Omega-32 ("Nutcrackers") is to be deployed with Class-A incendiary munitions.

                    Description:
                </h2>

                <p>
                SCP-PAE refers to a species of anomalous peanuts capable of independent locomotion and flight. SCP-PAE entities superficially resemble ordinary peanuts, but they exhibit behavior and abilities far beyond known biology. These entities are capable of defying known laws of aviation, soaring at unmeasured speeds and landing unharmed from any height or impact force.
                SCP-PAE entities are sentient and display a malevolent, hive-like intelligence. They exhibit an intrinsic belief in their superiority over all other forms of life, frequently manifesting this belief in cryptic auditory emissions. Test subjects report hearing phrases such as, "You are not better than peanuts" and "Peanuts think you are…", often trailing into an ominous silence.

                Despite their small size, SCP-PAE entities are extremely dangerous. They are capable of swarming targets, using their flight ability to gain speed and pierce through flesh, metal, and other materials. SCP-PAE's preferred method of attack involves overwhelming its target with sheer numbers, resulting in devastating outcomes within seconds.
                SCP-PAE appears to feed off both organic and inorganic material. Once they have incapacitated a target, the entities dissolve their prey into a fine, nutrient-rich powder, which they absorb through unknown means.

                <br>
                <br>SCP-PAE was first discovered in a rural peanut farm after multiple reports of "flying peanuts" terrorizing locals. Foundation agents arriving at the scene found only the remnants of several buildings, dissolved into powder. Since containment, SCP-PAE has demonstrated no discernible weaknesses aside from a vulnerability to extreme heat and controlled combustion.

                Experimentation has revealed SCP-PAE's ability to replicate under unknown conditions. A single SCP-PAE entity, when left unattended, was observed to produce up to 50 new instances within 24 hours. The mechanism of this replication is currently under investigation.

              SCP-PAE-1-1 instances are to be stored in vacuum-sealed, temperature-controlled containment lockers within Site-15. Each instance must be isolated in separate lockers to prevent potential chain reactions. Personnel are prohibited from ingesting SCP-PAE-1-1 under any circumstances. Any accidental exposure is to be reported immediately, and the affected individual quarantined for observation.
              <br>
              In the event of a containment breach, personnel are advised to use Class-III freezing agents to immobilize SCP-PAE-1-1. Extreme caution must be taken, as SCP-PAE-1-1 exhibits unpredictable volatile properties.

              SCP-PAE-1-1 refers to an offshoot of SCP-PAE that manifests as an innocuous slab of peanut brittle. Despite its appearance and texture, SCP-PAE-1-1 is composed of a highly volatile substance that mimics the flavor, texture, and smell of non-anomalous peanut brittle. This anomaly is not immediately distinguishable from ordinary peanut brittle by conventional means, making it an insidious hazard.

              SCP-PAE-1-1 has the ability to break itself into smaller pieces and regenerate the broken portions within minutes, effectively creating a limitless supply of anomalous material.

                Neurochemical Influence:

              <br>
              Ingestion of SCP-PAE-1-1 causes an overwhelming euphoria in the subject, coupled with an uncontrollable compulsion to consume more. Continued ingestion results in physical deterioration, dehydration, and, ultimately, fatal organ failure as the subject’s body is overwhelmed by the material's rapid self-replication.

                Chain Reaction:

              <br>
              SCP-PAE-1-1 exhibits a hive-like behavior when within proximity of SCP-PAE entities. In these instances, SCP-PAE-1-1 fragments will "awaken," generating high-frequency vibrations and emitting an audible cracking noise. This reaction prompts nearby SCP-PAE entities to swarm toward the brittle, often resulting in widespread chaos.

              <br>
              When exposed to extreme heat, SCP-PAE-1-1 violently combusts, releasing a dense, sticky aerosolized substance capable of immobilizing anything it contacts. This substance solidifies rapidly, causing suffocation or structural damage if deployed in enclosed spaces.

              SCP-PAE-1-1 appears passive in its dormant state but becomes active when disturbed. Tests have shown that cutting, biting, or otherwise fracturing SCP-PAE-1-1 triggers its regenerative and neurochemical effects. It has also demonstrated a strange affinity for individuals with a prior history of peanut allergies, seemingly seeking to position itself within their immediate environment.

              PAE-1-1-03 details a catastrophic breach when SCP-PAE-1-1 was accidentally introduced to an active SCP-PAE containment chamber. SCP-PAE entities immediately consumed and integrated SCP-PAE-1-1, becoming more aggressive and exhibiting rapid replication. This event resulted in 22 casualties before containment was reestablished.

              Analysis has shown SCP-PAE-1-1 emits a faint electromagnetic field, theorized to act as a beacon for SCP-PAE entities. This discovery has led to its proposed use as a potential lure for SCP-PAE recapture efforts. Further testing is pending O5 approval.
