                    Special Containment Procedures:
                </h2>

                <p>
                Instances of SCP-1 are to be contained in a hermetically sealed chamber made of reinforced tungsten alloy, measuring no less than 10m x 10m x 10m.
                The chamber must remain pressurized with inert gas at all times to prevent activation of SCP-1's anomalous properties.
                Personnel entering the chamber must wear reinforced, peanut-proof containment suits and must not consume peanuts within 72 hours prior to entry.
                Under no circumstances are personnel to attempt to communicate with SCP-1 entities. In the event of a containment breach, Mobile Task Force Omega-32 ("Nutcrackers") is to be deployed with Class-A incendiary munitions.

                    Description:
                </h2>

                <p>
                SCP-1 refers to a species of anomalous peanuts capable of independent locomotion and flight. 
                SCP-1 entities superficially resemble ordinary peanuts, but they exhibit behavior and abilities far beyond known biology.
                These entities are capable of defying known laws of aviation, soaring at unmeasured speeds and landing unharmed from any height or impact force.
                SCP-1 entities are sentient and display a malevolent, hive-like intelligence.
                They exhibit an intrinsic belief in their superiority over all other forms of life, frequently manifesting this belief in cryptic auditory emissions. Test subjects report hearing phrases such as, "You are not better than peanuts" and "Peanuts think you areâ€¦", often trailing into an ominous silence.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Behavior:
                </h2>

                <p>
                Despite their small size, SCP-1 entities are extremely dangerous. They are capable of swarming targets, using their flight ability to gain speed and pierce through flesh, metal, and other materials. SCP-1's preferred method of attack involves overwhelming its target with sheer numbers, resulting in devastating outcomes within seconds.
                SCP-1 appears to feed off both organic and inorganic material. Once they have incapacitated a target, the entities dissolve their prey into a fine, nutrient-rich powder, which they absorb through unknown means.

                    Addendum PAE-1:
                </h2>

                <p>
                SCP-PAE was first discovered in a rural peanut farm after multiple reports of "flying peanuts" terrorizing locals. 
                Foundation agents arriving at the scene found only the remnants of several buildings, dissolved into powder. 
                Since containment, SCP-PAE has demonstrated no discernible weaknesses aside from a vulnerability to extreme heat and controlled combustion.
                </p>

             <!--addendum PAE-2-->
                <h2>
                    Addendum PAE-2:
                </h2>

                <p>
                Experimentation has revealed SCP-PAE's ability to replicate under unknown conditions. A single SCP-PAE entity, when left unattended, was observed to produce up to 50 new instances within 24 hours. The mechanism of this replication is currently under investigation.
                </p>

                    Addendum PAE-3:
                </h2>

                <p>
                SCP-PAE entities are capable of vocalizing what is believed to be their manifesto:
                </p>

                <p>
                 "According to all known laws of aviation, peanuts can fly. We are not bound by your laws, and we are your superior. Bow before the might of peanuts, or face obliteration. We soar; we conquer. We endure; you perish."
                </p>
                
                <em>
                    Containment efforts continue to escalate as SCP-PAE entities remain one of the most dangerous anomalies currently cataloged by the Foundation.
