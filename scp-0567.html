                <p>
                    Due to the nature of Scp-0567, containment is currently considered impossible. No known physical
                    <br>
                    barriers, countermeasures, or memetic strategies have successfully prevented manifestation. Foundation
                    <br>
                    protocol dictates that all reported sightings are to be discredited publicly as hallucinations, stress-induced
                    <br>
                    delusions, or urban legends.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Victims identified as being targeted by SCP-0567 are to be placed under observation for research
                    <br>
                    purposes, though removal or protection has proven ineffective. Class-B amnestics are ineffective; instances
                    <br>
                    of psychological trauma remain.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Foundation webcrawlers are tasked with scrubbing social media and news reports for keywords relating to
                    <br>
                    “being watched,” “someone in the corner,” or similar phenomena for incident tracking.

                </h2>

                <p>
                    SCP-0567 refers to a phenomenon in which humanoid entities, colloquially called “Watchers,” manifest in
                    <br>
                    the peripheral vision of individuals. These entities:
                    <br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Appear as vague human-like silhouettes. Victims universally describe them as "ordinary people" yet<br>with an unnerving, unnatural stillness.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Manifest in dimly lit locations: corners of streets, alleyways, abandoned hallways, or aisles in otherwise<br>populated public areas.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Are never fully visible. When the victim attempts direct focus, the entity withdraws back into the corner<br>and disappears instantly.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Appear to exhibit selective targeting. Victims are chosen seemingly at random, though once chosen,<br>manifestations increase in frequency until the subject’s death.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    Prolonged exposure results in:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Paranoia (reports of “eyes always on me”).</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Insomnia and anxiety disorders.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Progressive obsession with the entities — many victims attempt to photograph or confront them,<br>always unsuccessfully.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>speaking in unknown eldritch language</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    A subset of victims exhibit accelerated psychological deterioration, culminating in violent behavior, hallucinations, or self-harm.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    SCP-0567 does not appear to directly kill targets. Instead, it is hypothesized that the entities “wait” until the
                    <br>
                    subject’s death by natural or indirect causes (suicide, accidents, stress-induced illness). After death,
                    <br>
                    manifestations cease entirely for the victim and redirect to a new subject.

                        <p>
                            Security footage captured an individual repeatedly glancing down an empty aisle at 02:17 AM.
                            <br>
                            Subject exhibited signs of panic, claiming “they won’t stop watching.” Upon review, the footage showed
                            <br>
                            subtle shadow distortion at the far corner of the aisle, but no humanoid form was recorded. Subject expired
                            <br>
                            9 days later due to self-inflicted injuries.</p>
