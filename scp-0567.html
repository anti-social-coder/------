                <p>
                    SCP-0567 refers to a phenomenon in which humanoid entities, colloquially called “Watchers,” manifest in
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    the peripheral vision of individuals. These entities:
                    <br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Appear as vague human-like silhouettes. Victims universally describe them as "ordinary people" yet<br>with an unnerving, unnatural stillness.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Manifest in dimly lit locations: corners of streets, alleyways, abandoned hallways, or aisles in otherwise<br>populated public areas.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Are never fully visible. When the victim attempts direct focus, the entity withdraws back into the corner<br>and disappears instantly.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Appear to exhibit selective targeting. Victims are chosen seemingly at random, though once chosen,<br>manifestations increase in frequency until the subject’s death.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Prolonged exposure results in:

                        <br>
                        <li>Progressive obsession with the entities — many victims attempt to photograph or confront them,<br>always unsuccessfully.</li>
                        <br>
