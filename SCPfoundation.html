                <p>
                    SCP-3421 is to be contained within a vacuum-sealed, lead-lined storage unit at Site-77’s High-Security Containment Vault. The unit is to be housed inside a 5m x 5m x 5m reinforced isolation chamber under 24/7 surveillance. Access is restricted to Level 4 personnel and above, and only under O5 directive. Interaction time must not exceed 60 minutes under any circumstances.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Any personnel exhibiting signs of psychological agitation, compulsive behaviors, or fixation following exposure to SCP-3421 are to be terminated on-site or transferred to Biohazard Disposal Wing-4 for incineration. No attempts at psychological rehabilitation are to be made.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the event that SCP-3421-influenced individuals breach containment protocols, MTF Theta-9 (“Skullcrushers”) is authorized to use lethal force. Any external civilian group exhibiting SCP-3421-related behavior patterns is to be treated as a Class-K memetic outbreak.

                <h2>
                    Description:
                </h2>

                <p>
                    SCP-3421 is an anomalous human skull, heavily weathered and of indeterminate age. The skull appears to belong to a male of prehistoric European origin, but radiocarbon dating has produced conflicting results, ranging from 40,000 BCE to 300 CE. Notably, the skull is cracked at the rear occipital bone, consistent with blunt-force trauma.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When a human subject is within a 2-meter radius of SCP-3421 for longer than one (1) hour, the entity begins to engage in non-verbal, telepathic communication. Subjects report auditory hallucinations described as whispers in a “rasping, ancient dialect,” and visual distortions involving blood, fire, and mutilated figures.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After the 60-minute threshold is crossed, subjects undergo irreversible psychological transformation. Affected individuals demonstrate:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extreme bloodlust</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Compulsive violent ideation</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Loss of empathy and moral restraint</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Intense fixation on SCP-3421</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                     condition is permanent and appears to resist all known forms of therapy, amnestics, or neurological intervention. Victims become obsessed with “feeding” SCP-3421 through violence, though the object itself does not physically respond to blood or sacrifices. The compulsion is entirely psychological but grows stronger over time.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     If isolated, infected individuals will attempt to recruit others, forming cult-like groups centered on SCP-3421. These groups exhibit ritualistic behavior, often involving human sacrifice, and the spread of SCP-3421’s influence appears memetically transmissible through speech, writing, or shared hallucinations.
                    </p>

                    Addendum 1-A-Discovery
                </h2>

                <p>
                    SCP-3421 was discovered in a cave network near ████████, Turkey, following reports of mass disappearances and ritualistic killings in a nearby village. A Foundation excavation team recovered the skull at the center of a large bloodstained chamber, surrounded by the remains of 37 individuals arranged in a radial formation. All remains exhibited signs of self-inflicted cranial trauma and exsanguination.
                </p>

                    <h4>Date:</h4> <p>██/██/20██</p>

                    <p>Dr. H. Krauss, Research Assistant N. Lowell</p>
                    <h4>Summary:</h4>
                    <p>During a controlled observation, Assistant Lowell remained within range of SCP-3421 for 1 hour and 17 minutes due to a failure in rotation protocol. Within two hours, Lowell exhibited homicidal behavior, murdering three staff members before being terminated by security.</p>
                   <p>Post-mortem analysis revealed carvings in Lowell’s skin resembling Sumerian glyphs. Foundation linguists are currently decoding the symbols.</p>

                </h2>

                
                <p>
                    Multiple off-site incidents linked to SCP-3421 have been documented. All involve similar behavioral patterns: spontaneous acts of mass violence, ritualistic bloodletting, and repeated references to "the voice beneath the bone" or "the gnawing silence." In one case, a subject who had never directly encountered the skull replicated its exact structure using human remains.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Containment protocols have been expanded. SCP-3421’s influence is now considered memetically transmittable under certain conditions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Any individual who remains within SCP-3421’s telepathic field for longer than 60 minutes is to be designated as SCP-3421-1. These instances undergo permanent psychological and neurological transformation, resulting in a complete loss of identity and the emergence of a new consciousness wholly devoted to SCP-3421.
                    <br>
                    <h4>Behavioral traits of SCP-3421-1 include:</h4>
            
                    <ul>
                        <li>Obsessive reverence for SCP-3421</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Psychotic fixation on blood rituals and human sacrifice</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Ritualistic behaviors and compulsive bone-related carvings</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Telepathic synchronization with other SCP-3421-1 instances</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Hostility toward non-affected individuals, particularly those who interfere with SCP-3421</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Instances are no longer cognitively or ethically human and display intelligence levels equivalent to or exceeding baseline. All recorded cases show an advanced understanding of anatomy, symbolic language, and group coordination without formal training.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    SCP-3421-1 instances are capable of forming cult-like groups and will attempt to spread SCP-3421’s influence via speech, written symbols, and visual hallucinations. These secondary vectors are currently under study for possible memetic contamination.

                        <li>Self-inflicted carvings of skull-like symbols into skin</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Attempted “resurrection ritual” involving the corpse of a deceased D-Class</li>
