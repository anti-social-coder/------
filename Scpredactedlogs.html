   <p>
    <h4>Subject:</h4> <p>SCP-3421-1- ██ (formerly Dr. █████ ████)</p>
    <h4>Date:</h4> <p>██/██/20██</p>

    <p>SCP-3421-1- ██ was the only known instance to retain full speech, memory, and cognitive function following transformation. Initially believed to be recoverable, the subject's growing influence over nearby personnel and containment staff led to reassessment. Interview was permitted under controlled conditions with failsafes in place. Subject was terminated less than 24 hours later.</p>

    [BEGIN LOG]
   </h3>

   <p>
    Dr. Rylin: Good afternoon. Please state your name for the record.
    <br>
    <br>
    SCP-3421-1-██: I had a name once. You already know it. But names are soft. Flesh is soft. It rots. I am not soft anymore.
    <br>
    <br>
    Dr. Rylin: For clarity: you were Dr. █████ ████. Senior Cognitohazard Analyst. Is that correct?
    <br>
    <br>
    SCP-3421-1-██: [Smiles]
    <br>
    I was the first to listen. The others heard noise. I heard instruction.
    <br>
    <br>
    Dr. Rylin: Instruction from the skull?
    <br>
    <br>
    SCP-3421-1-██: From beneath the skull. The bone is only the door. You keep staring at the door, doctor. You're terrified of what's knocking.
    <br>
    <br>
    Dr. Rylin: What did it tell you?
    <br>
    <br>
    SCP-3421-1-██: It didn't "tell." It showed. [Leans forward]
    <br>
    It showed me that blood is not life. Obsession is.
    <br>
    It showed me that your "containment" is a cage for you, not for it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Dr. Rylin: What is it?
    <br>
    <br>
    SCP-3421-1-██: [Pauses. Smiles wider.]
    <br>
    You think it is an entity. A being. You think it’s in that room down the hall.
    But it’s not there anymore. It’s here now. [taps temple]
    <br>
    <br>
    Dr. Rylin: We've confirmed that prolonged exposure to SCP-3421 causes irreversible psychological changes. You're aware of that?
    <br>
    <br>
    SCP-3421-1-██: "Irreversible." Such a sad little word. You're afraid that what I’ve become might be... contagious.
    <br>
    <br>
    Dr. Rylin: It is. And that's exactly why you're being kept isolated. The others you've influenced — they’ve been terminated.
    <br>
    <br>
    SCP-3421-1-██: [Tilts head]
    <br>
    Terminated? No.
    <br>
    They’ve been returned. Returned to him. To It. To the choir.
    <br>
    <br>
    Dr. Rylin: Are you saying SCP-3421 is worshipped?
    <br>
    <br>
    SCP-3421-1-██: Not worshipped. Followed. It is not a god. It is not a devil. It is an idea that refuses to die. It has no mouth and it still sings.
    <br>
    <br>
    Dr. Rylin: Final question. Do you regret what happened?
    <br>
    <br>
    SCP-3421-1-██: Regret? No.
    <br>
    But you will.
    <br>
    When your skull splits from the inside, you’ll remember this moment.
    <br>
    And you’ll understand why it chose me first.
    <br>
    [Silence for 11 seconds. Dr. Rylin signals to end interview.]
    <br>

<!--Incidents after Interaction-->

  <p>
    <h2>After the Interview</h2>
    <p>Less than 12 hours after this interview, six personnel exhibited early-stage SCP-3421-1 symptoms — despite no physical contact with the subject or SCP-3421. Two staff attempted to smuggle bone fragments out of the containment wing. One carved the phrase "He sees all" into her palms before being apprehended.
    <br>
SCP-3421-1-██ was terminated via incineration protocol at 04:19 the following morning.
