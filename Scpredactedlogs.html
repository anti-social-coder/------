<!--Addendum 3421-E: Interview Log 3421-1-██ ("The Orator")-->

   <p>
    Subject: SCP-3421-1- ██ (formerly Dr. █████ ████)
    <br>
    Date: ██/██/20██
    <br>
    Interviewer: Dr. Elswen Rylin
    <br>
    Location: Site-77, Containment Interview Room 3
    <br>
    Security Detail: Armed Response Unit stationed outside chamber
    <br>
    <br>
    SCP-3421-1- ██ was the only known instance to retain full speech, memory, and cognitive function following transformation. Initially believed to be recoverable, the subject's growing influence over nearby personnel and containment staff led to reassessment. Interview was permitted under controlled conditions with failsafes in place. Subject was terminated less than 24 hours later.

    SCP-3421-1-██: I had a name once. You already know it. But names are soft. Flesh is soft. It rots. I am not soft anymore.
